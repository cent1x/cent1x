👋 Hi there, I’m @cent1x!

👀 I’m interested in a wide range of topics including electronics projects, computer science, gaming, Discord, and game server development. I also have a passion for climbing and kart racing.

🌱 Currently, I’m deepening my knowledge in C#, Azure, and Sharepoint Management. I've been working as an IT professional specializing in Sharepoint management for some time now, and I've been honing my skills in C# and VB .NET for the past six years. I'm particularly fascinated by MSSQL and the intricacies of database creation.

💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on creating C# code for plugins or any exciting projects related to my interests!
